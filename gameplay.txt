2. General idea of War the card game
    - Goal: be first player to win all 52 cards
    - The Deal:
        - deck evenly divided
            - both players recieve 26 cards, dealt one at a time face down. Anyone may 
            deal first, each player places stack of cards face down in front of them.
    - The Play:
        - Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card
        takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of his/her stack.
            - If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player turns up one card face
            down and one card face up. The player with the higher cards takes both piles
            (six cards). If the turned up cards are again the same rank, each player places another
            card face down and turns another card face up. The player with the higher card takes
            all ten cards and so on.

    - How to keep score:
        - The game ends when one player has won all the cards.
